# HobbyExchange
Skill Exchange A web application where users enter skills that they have and skills that they want to learn.  For example, if user 1 wants to learn guitar and is good at coding, they can be matched to user 2 who can teach guitar and wants to learn coding.    Each user will list several skills that they have and several skills that they want to learn.   Then when there is a match, the user will will be notified and will be able to contact their teacher/ student to meet up and exchange skills
